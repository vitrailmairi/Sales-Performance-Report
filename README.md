Based on the results of sales per year, total sales every year tend to increase, but in 2012 total sales were not greater than total sales in 2009 and the number of orders completed each year there was no significant growth and even decreased in 2011.

# Overall Performance by Product Sub Category
Overall performance of DQLab by product subcategory to be compared between 2011 and 2012

There is an increase and decrease in total sales for each product subcategory in one year. The highest total sales in 2011 and 2012 were still dominated by product subcategories that tended to be the same, namely Chairs & Chairmats, Office Machines, and Tables, while the lowest total sales are Labels, Scissors, Rulers & Trimmers, and Rubber Bands.

# Promotion Effectiveness and Efficiency by Years
The effectiveness and efficiency of the promotions that have been carried out so far, by calculating the burn rate of the overall promotions by year

Every year the percentage of burn rate tends to increase, which means that promotion costs continue to increase every year. The impact of increased promotion costs is to increase in total sales, but the promotion that has increased sales cannot be said to be effective and efficient because the percentage of burn rate exceeds the maximum limit (> 4.5%).

# Promotion Effectiveness and Efficiency by Product Sub Category
The effectiveness and efficiency of the promotions that have been carried out so far, by calculating the burn rate of the promotions carried out as a whole based on subcategories

A significant increase has not occurred in the sub category of company product sales. In 2012 there were several product subcategories with a burn rate percentage lower than 4.5%. Meanwhile, several product subcategories with a high combustion rate, which is greater than 4.5% actually have a low level of sales.

Every year the number of customers who make transactions tends to be stagnant or the same, even decreasing in 2011.
